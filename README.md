Remote controller with esp32. 
 
Almost every project use Arduino-like code(this is not good).  
We use Espressif(this is good).  
  
Controller use 3 buttons and 2 analogue peripherals, wifi setup  
and tcp socket client for sending data to the server.  
A little bit of exception handling for reconnection, etc...
